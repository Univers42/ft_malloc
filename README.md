# ALLOCATION DYNAMIC UTILS

to start my own implementation of malloc and related functins, I shall begin by designing and coding my own allocatoor in a main source file.

The step I've chosen to follow are the followed :
1. implement the core allocator logic: manage a memory pool handling allocatin and freeing, and maintain free lists or blocks.
2. Then, I'll provide basic functions: malloc, free, realloc, calloc, memalign, valloc..
3. Next, I will add debugging, tracing, and statistics features as separate modules.
